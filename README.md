# A simple playgound for the Contentful RichText Converter

This is just a simple playground for handling HTML til RichText in the frontend/browser.

Currently the playground is unstable due to changes on the core package being that the package is be handling both node and browser usage.
(Currently it only supports node version)

The playground will be the "test" of the browser usage of the Contentful RichText Converter.
